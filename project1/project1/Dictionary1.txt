MOST ORGANIZATIONS TODAY DEPEND ON THE USE OF DATA IN TWO GENERAL WAYS STANDARD BUSINESS PROCESSES U
SE DATA FOR EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS SUPPORTING OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES BUSINESS ANALYSTS RE
VIEW DATA CAPTURED AS A RESULT OF DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS THROUGH REPORTS AND ANALYSIS ENGINES AS A WA
AY OF IDENTIFYING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFICIENCY OR GROWTH IN OTHER WORDS DATA IS USED TO BOTH RUN
AND IMPROVE THE WAYS THAT ORGANIZATIONS ACHIEVE THEIR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IF THAT IS TRUE THEN THERE
MUST BE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT DATA IS OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY TO MEET THE BUSINESS NEEDS T
HEREFORE IT IS OF GREAT VALUE TO ANY ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO INCORPORATE A PROGRAM THA
T INCLUDES PROCESSES FOR ASSESSING MEASURING REPORTING REACTING TO AND CONTROLLING THE RISKS ASSOCIA
TED WITH POOR DATA QUALITY FLAWS IN ANY PROCESS ARE BOUND TO INTRODUCE RISKS TO SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE
NG THE OBJECTIVES THAT DRIVE YOUR ORGANIZATIONS DAILY ACTIVITIES IF THE FLAWS ARE INTRODUCED IN A TO
YPICAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT TAKES RAW INPUT AND GENERATES A SINGLE OUTPUT THE RISKS OF SIGNIFY
CANT IMPACT MIGHT BE MITIGATED BY CLOSELY CONTROLLING THE QUALITY OF THE PROCESS OVERSEEING THE ACTI
VITIES FROM END TO END AND MAKING SURE THAT ANY IMPERFECTIONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
INFORMATION IS AN ASSET THAT IS GENERATED THROUGH NUMEROUS PROCESSES WITH MULTIPLE FEEDS OF RAW DATA
THAT ARE COMBINED PROCESSED AND FED OUT TO MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE YOUR ORGANIZAT
TION BECAUSE DATA IS OF A MUCH MORE DYNAMIC NATURE CREATED AND USED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL
AND ANALYTICAL APPLICATIONS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING WAYS TO ASSESS THE RISKS
RELATED TO DATA FAILURES AS WELL AS WAYS TO MONITOR CONFORMANCE TO BUSINESS USER EXPECTATIONS THIS U
NCOVERS A DEEPER QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE INTRODUCTION OF FLAWED DATA IMPACT THE WAY THAT YO
UR ORGANIZATION DOES BUSINESS WHILE IT IS PROBABLY EASY TO POINT TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF WHERE UNEXP
ECTED DATA LED TO BUSINESS PROBLEMS THERE IS BOUND TO BE REAL EVIDENCE OF HARD IMPACTS THAT CAN BE D
IRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY DATA ANECDOTES ARE STRONG MOTIVATORS IN THAT THEY RAISE AWARENE
SS OF DATA QUALITY AS AN ISSUE BUT OUR INTENTION IS TO DEVELOP A PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK TH
AT HELPS TO IDENTIFY ISOLATE MEASURE AND IMPROVE THE VALUE OF DATA WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT THE PROBLE
IS THAT THE MAGNITUDE AND CHALLENGE OF CORRELATING BUSINESS IMPACTS WITH DATA FAILURES APPEARS TO BE
TOO LARGE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE  THUS THE RELIANCE ON ANECDOTES TO JUSTIFY AN INVESTMENT IN GOOD DATA
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BUT WE CAN COMPARE THE JOB OF CHARACTERIZING THE IMPACTS OF POOR DATA QUALITY T
EATING AN ELEPHANT IT SEEMS PRETTY BIG BUT IF WE CAN CARVE IT DOWN INTO SMALL ENOUGH CHUNKS IT CAN B
DONE ONE BITE AT A TIME TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE VALUE OF DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IT IS NECESS
ARY TO BE ABLE TO CHARACTERIZE THE LOSS OF VALUE THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO POOR DATA QUALITY IS INFORM
ATION AN ORGANIZATIONAL ASSET CERTAINLY IF ALL A COMPANY DOES IS ACCUMULATE STORE DATA THERE IS SOME
COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THAT DATA THE COSTS OF STORAGE MAINTENANCE OFFICE SPA
SUPPORT STAFF AND SO ON AND THIS COULD SHOW UP ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A LIABILITY THOUGH IT IS UNLI
KELY THAT ANY CORPORATION LISTS ITS DATA AS A LINE ITEM AS EITHER AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY ON ITS BAL
ANCE SHEET THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BECAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT DEPENDENCE ON DATA TO BOTH RUN AND IMPROV
THE BUSINESS SENIOR MANAGERS AT MOST ORGANIZATIONS CERTAINLY RELY ON THEIR DATA AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER
ASSET WE CAN VIEW DATA AS AN ASSET SINCE DATA CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE COMPANY IT IS C
ONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION IT IS THE RESULT OF A SEQUENCE OF TRANSACTIONS EITHER AS THE RESULT OF
INTERNAL DATA CREATION INTERNALLY OR EXTERNAL DATA ACQUISITION IT INCURS COSTS FOR ACQUISITION AND M
ANAGEMENT AND IT IS USED TO CREATE VALUE DATA IS NOT TREATED AS AN ASSET THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS
NO DEPRECIATION SCHEDULE FOR PURCHASED DATA ON THE OTHER HAND THE DEPENDENCE OF AUTOMATED OPERATIONA
SYSTEMS ON DATA FOR PROCESSING CLEARLY SHOWS HOW DATA IS USED TO CREATE VALUE TRANSACTION SYSTEMS TH
AT MANAGE THE DAILY OPERATIONS ENABLE BUSINESS AS USUAL AND WHEN ANALYTIC SYSTEMS ARE USED FOR REPOR
TING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND DISCOVERY OF NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THE VALUE OF THAT INFORMATIO
SHOWN YET AGAIN BUT IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO ASSIGN A DIRECT MONETARY VALUE TO ANY SPECIFIC DATA VAL
FOR EXAMPLE WHILE A COMPUTING SYSTEM MAY EXPECT TO SEE A COMPLETE RECORD TO BE PROCESSED A TRANSACTI
MAY STILL BE COMPLETE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME OF THE DATA ELEMENTS DOES THIS IMPLY THAT THOSE DA
ELEMENTS HAVE NO VALUE OF COURSE NOT OTHERWISE THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN EXPECTATION FOR THOSE EL
EMENTS TO BE POPULATED IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT INFORMATION VALUE T
SIMPLEST APPROACHES CONSIDER THE COST OF ACQUISITION IE THE DATA IS WORTH WHAT WE PAID FOR IT OR ITS
MARKET VALUE IE WHAT SOMEONE IS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT BUT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE DATA IS CREATED ST
ORED PROCESSED EXCHANGED SHARED AGGREGATED AND REUSED PERHAPS THE BEST APPROACH FOR UNDERSTANDING IN
VALUE IS ITS UTILITY THE EXPECTED VALUE TO BE DERIVED FROM THE INFORMATION THAT VALUE CAN GROW AS FU
NCTION OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS RANGING FROM STRICTLY OPERATIONAL TO STRATEGIC SALES TRA
ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE SALES PROCESS AND THEREFORE PART OF YOUR SALES REVENUES ARE RELATED TO
THE DATA USED TO PROCESS THE TRANSACTION DAILY PERFORMANCE REPORTS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY AND ELIMINAT
HIGH COST LOW PRODUCTIVITY ACTIVITIES AND THEREFORE THE MONEY SAVED IS RELATED TO THE DATA THAT COMP
OSED THE REPORT STREAMLINED PROCESSING SYSTEMS THAT EXPECT HIGH QUALITY DATA CAN PROCESS MANY TRANSA
CTIONS WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION AND AS THE VOLUME OF PROCESSED TRANSACTIONS INCREASES THE COST PER
TRANSACTION DECREASES WHICH REPRESENTS YET ANOTHER UTILITY VALUE FOR DATAALL OF THESE EXAMPLES INTRO
AN INTERESTING POINT WHILE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT IN MOST INSTANCES TO DIRECTLY ASSIGN A MONETARY VALUE
TO A PIECE OF DATA IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPLORE HOW THE UTILITY VALUE CHANGES WHEN THE DATA DOES NOT ME
BUSINESS CLIENT EXPECTATIONS IN OTHER WORDS IT IS POSSIBLE TO ANALYZE HOW DATA IS BEING USED FOR ACH
IEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND HOW THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE GOALS IS IMPEDED WHEN FLAWED DATA IS INT
RODUCED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TO DO THIS WE MUST CONSIDER THE GENERAL APPROACH TO CORRELATING BUSINES

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FRAUD PAYMENTS ATTEMPTING TO LINK BUSINESS IMPACTS TO DATA QUALITY ISSUE

RRECTING PROBLEMS AS OPPOSED TO COSTS INCURRED BY IGNORING THEM AND THEN DETERMINE THE NEXT STEPS BY
REFINING THE TYPES OF COSTS EG DIRECT VERSUS INDIRECT COSTS ANALYSTS COULD GET A BETTER IDEA ABOUT P
